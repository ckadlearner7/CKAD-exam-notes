## CORE CONCEPTS
The core concepts section covers the core K8s API and its primitives and resources. It also covers the important concept of a POD. This is the basic unit of deployment for app developers and so this 'POD' concept is important to understand as well as how they are managed with kubectl. To me, this is embodied in the kubectl RUN command.
